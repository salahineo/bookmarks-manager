### Goal

These are free resources for web developers and designers controlled by full functionality application. I coded this
project to practice on my knowledge HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, jQuery UI, AJAX, PHP, MySQL in a real project.

> Install this application on your environment with a virtual host like `resources.local` to access this application quickly

### Benefits

Here are some ideas to benefit from this project:

- Take this project as a task and try to make it, and if you could not do a specific section, see how I make it in the
  source code (use comments to reach this section).
- Extract a code of a specific section and use it in your project.
- Review source code to see how other people code their projects.
- Edit on this project after studying its code well, to know how to work in pair-programming with other people
- Upgrade this project, and add your own sections or pages

### Installation

Here are the guidelines to run this project on your localhost:

1. Download, then install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) web server
2. Download this project, then rename its directory to `resources`
3. Copy the `resources` directory to the `htdocs` directory which exists in XAMPP installation path
4. Start XAMPP control panel from your Desktop, then start `Apache` web server, and `MySQL` server
5. Open your browser, and type `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`, to open PHPMyAdmin home page
6. Create a new database with the name `resources`
7. Import the `resources.sql` file to this database (This file located in `sql` directory)
5. Open your browser, and type `http://localhost/bookmarks`, to open the home page of the website

> You must make a virtual host like `resources.local` for this project, otherwise you will encounter non-accurate routes. If you don't know how to make it, then it is the time to search ^^

> Don't forget to edit the `/include/database.php` file with your Database credentials

> You can use this [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/get-favicon/gpipahagclehninhhjkhbkliinfofnhe) to download websites favicons for your links

### Contributing Guidelines

Here are the guidelines to contribute to this project for adding more resources:

- Add any resources you want in your localhost, then export the database file and replace it with the old one which
  exists in the sql directory
- Pull requests allowed with a change in the database (.sql) file only
- Pull request title should include resource name, resource section
  - Example: `[Bootstrap] -> [CSS Frameworks]`
- It is better to add resource link in the pull request comment section
  - Example: `[Link] -> [https://getbootstrap.com/]`
- Adding to single resource section, or create new resource section in one pull request as it will allow for easier
  review
- Double check if the resource is truly free without any kind of hidden surprises.
